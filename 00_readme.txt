Todo:
I. pos info in the xml file:
   compare lemma form with lemmata from the existing smaX files
   when adding data to the existing sma_oahpa

 - possible problems: 
  1. lemma found in smaoahpa files but with different pos values
  2. lemma found with exactly one pos value but potentially different values
  3. lemma not found

II. cleanup entries

III. CLT have to agree on a common practice when working with inc-files and xml-files
generated from csv inc-files.
 1. I proposed that inc-files should be the very original ones, this implies that
    they should NOT be changed.
 2. Why not to work with the xml-transformed data if already there?

 3. If the inc-file are changed then at least the structure should be kept.
