Todo:
I. pos info in the xml file:
   compare lemma form with lemmata from the existing smaX files
   when adding data to the existing sma_oahpa

 - possible problems: 
  1. lemma found in smaoahpa files but with different pos values
  2. lemma found with exactly one pos value but potentially different values
  3. lemma not found

II. cleanup entries
